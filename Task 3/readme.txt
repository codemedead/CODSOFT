This code is a basic implementation of a Contact Book application using Python's tkinter library for the GUI. It enables users to manage contacts by adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting entries. The interface offers entry fields for Name, Phone Number, Email, and Address, along with buttons to perform specific actions like adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts. The code maintains a contacts list where each contact is stored as a dictionary containing the aforementioned details. It utilizes Listbox to display contacts and provides functionality to interact with and modify the contact details. Additionally, it includes validation checks for mandatory fields like Name and Phone Number, ensuring essential information is entered before adding a contact. The code structure organizes different functionalities into separate methods, enhancing readability and maintainability.
